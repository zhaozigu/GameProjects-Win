## Introduction

The code is mainly derived from [gameprogcpp/code](https://github.com/gameprogcpp/code). This repository uses modern C++ features as much as possible to refactor it. Therefore, this repository can be considered as my learning process. The code in this repository may not be as rigorous as actual software engineering, but it's a good example for beginners in game development. Finally, a big thank you to the original author, Sanjay Madhav.

## Usage

Typically, a `build` directory is created and then the following command is executed under the `build` directory: `cmake ..`
